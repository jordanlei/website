          <h2>Can Monkeys Play Board Games?</h2>
          <p>
            Planning is hard. How does the brain do it? We collaborated with Lee
            Lab at Johns Hopkins University to understand how monkeys plan when
            playing a complex planning game, Four-in-a-Row, against a computer
            opponent. We are building a model that combines gameplay, eye
            movement, and neural electrophysiological data to understand the
            neural mechanisms of planning.

          <h2>How Does Uncertainty Affect Planning Effort?</h2>
          <p>
            The future is often uncertain, which influences planning behavior.
            We designed an online task with three different types of uncertainty
            and modeled participant planning strategy. We found that people
            decreased their planning depth in response to increased uncertainty
            - intuitively, if the future is very uncertain, why bother planning
            deeply?

          <h2>How Do People Think Ahead in Chess?</h2>
          <p>
            For hundreds of years, chess has been associated with intelligence,
            strategy, and complex reasoning. Recent advances in artificial
            intelligence and the popularity of online chess make it an exciting
            time to study chess from a cognitive science perspective. In this
            project, we are building a cognitive model of how people think ahead
            in chess.
